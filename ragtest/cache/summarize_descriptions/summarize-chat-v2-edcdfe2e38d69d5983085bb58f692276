Furthermore, Mr. Scrooge is the uncle who is being discussed, known for his unique characteristics and behavior.\n\nNote: I resolved the apparent contradiction between \"Mr. Scrooge is a friend of Belle's\" (implying he has a partner) and \"leaving him alone in the world\" by assuming that the partner referred to is not Mr. Scrooge himself, but rather someone else who was close to him.
