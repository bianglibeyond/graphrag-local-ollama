He has collaborated on various projects, including a painting project with renowned artists Pascal Blanche and Alphonse Mucha. Notably, Teng is also the creator of a distinctive portrait of Bob Marley smoking, showcasing his skill in capturing iconic figures through his artwork.\n\nNote: I have resolved any potential contradictions by assuming that Sachin Teng's collaboration on a painting project with other artists does not preclude him from being a concept artist and illustrator himself.
